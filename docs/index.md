## **Overview**
This project is meant to be a starter pack of many of the ml project that I plan to do. I will try to be as clear as possible in my thought process and 
put those details in this document. Gender classification (GC) is a machine learning model that allows user to classify individuals based on ther body feature.

## **Data**
The dataset for this project can be obtained on kaggle at [GC :material-open-in-new:](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/elakiricoder/gender-classification-dataset?select=gender_classification_v7.csv). The data is structured as follows:
